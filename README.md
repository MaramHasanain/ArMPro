# ArMPro
This repo contains the *Arabic* multimodal propaganda dataset (**ArMPro**). The dataset covers two modalities, (1) text represented by annotated news paragraphs and (2) images and text represented by memes.

## Text Subset
This dataset represents the largest one to date for fine-grained propaganda detection. It includes **8,000** paragraphs extracted from over **2,800** Arabic news articles, covering a large variety of news domains. 


Example annotated paragraph:

### Data splits
We split the dataset in a stratified manner, allocating 75\%, 8.5\%, and 16.5\% for training, development, and testing, respectively. During the stratified sampling, the multilabel setting was considered when splitting the dataset. This ensures that persuasion techniques are similarly distributed across the splits.
